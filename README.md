# Simple Rewards Dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Ask
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2 x $20 + 1 x $50 = 90 points).
